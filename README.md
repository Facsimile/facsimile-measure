Facsimile Measurement Library
=============================

The _Facsimile_ project's _measure_ library is a collection of classes for measuring physical quanties, such as _time_,
_distance_, _mass_, _planar angles_, etc. in a variety of supported units.

Facsimile simulations run on the _Java Virtual Machine_ under _Microsoft Windows_, _Linux_, _Mac OS X_, _BSD_ and
_Unix_.
